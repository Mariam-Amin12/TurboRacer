## ✍️ Naming Conventions

Some Naming conventions to be followed while writing code.  

Definitions:  
1. `PascalCase` - First letter of each word is capitalized
2. `CamelCase`  - First letter of each word is capitalized except the first word
3. `UPPER_CASE` - All letters are capitalized and words are separated by `_`
4. `lower_case` - All letters are lower case and words are separated by `_`

### Files Names
Files Names should be written in `lower_case` and should be descriptive of the contents of the file.

### Variables
- Variables should be written in `camelCase`
- If you want to add a descriptive word before the variable, like `STR`, `ARR`, `CNT` (counter), etc., simply write it first and then add an underscore (_).
```Assembly

STR_playerOneName  DB 'player one name$'
carSpeed  DB 100H

```
